To keep what is still the most full featured JavaScript Date library alive, maintained, and improved. Currently we're on track towards a 1.0 release - having fixed almost all the exist bugs and added several new features, improved parsing, and many other changes.\n\n### How to Install/Use\nDateJS supports running either your regular web browser as a client library or Node.js.\n\n#### Node.js\nInstallaltion is as easy as running:\n\n    npm install datejs\n\n#### Web Browser \n * For production enviroments include [the production ready minified file from the Build directory](https://github.com/abritinthebay/datejs/blob/master/build/production/date.min.js) on your page. \n * For debugging (eg, in development) include [the unminfied and fully commented version](https://github.com/abritinthebay/datejs/blob/master/build/development/date.js)\n\nSupport for the Bower package manager is on the roadmap, but is not implemented yet.\n\n#### International Language Versions\nIn Node.js you can just call `Date.i18n.setLanguage` with the IETF appropriate code (e.g. \"de-DE\", or \"es-MX\") and DateJS will load the file automatically. For the browser DateJS has langauge support in one of two ways:\n 1. Download the appropriate file from [the Build directory](https://github.com/abritinthebay/datejs/blob/master/build/). Files are named after the IETF code the load (i.e. `date-es-MX.js` loads Mexican Spanish).\n 2. Set `Date.Config.i18n` to the location of [the internationalization files](https://github.com/abritinthebay/datejs/blob/master/src/i18n/) on your server and DateJS will dynamically load the files by script element insersion. \n\nDateJS will always support loading US English via `Date.i18n.setLanguage(\"en-US\")` no matter what other language is specifically loaded. So you can always support both your localization and the English speaking world.\n\n## File Structure\n* `build` Output from the Grunt powered build process\n    * `development` Non-minfied files with full comments. Suitable for development enviroments.\n    * `production` Fully minified (by Google's Closure Compiler) files suitable for production.  \n*  `src` All the source files used to build the final files.\n    * `core` The main DateJS source files.\n    * `i18n` Internationalization files. Language specifics (days of the week, regex formats,etc). Organized by IETF language tag (eg - en-US, etc).\n* `specs` Unit Tests written using [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/). Code coverage is calculated by [BlanketJS](http://blanketjs.org/). \n* `tests` Orginal unit tests for 2008 project. *Deprecated*.  \n",
